This research “Group Project” was conducted as part of the Research Methodology course. The objective was to explore how deep learning models could be used to
predict stock market trends using not only historical prices but also financial news. I contributed as the main developer in charge of implementing the dual-branch
deep learning architecture. This system combined LSTM, GRU, and TCNN to process historical stock data while integrating topic-sentiment vectors extracted using
FinBERT and BERTopic. The models were trained and evaluated using Apple stock (AAPL), and GRU showed the best performance with an R² score of 0.9866. This
project helped us understand the real-world challenges of data alignment, model tuning, and interpreting evaluation metrics in financial prediction tasks.
